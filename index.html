<p>ssh keys manager for multiple password protected keys. Stop adding them manually.</p>
<h3 id="what-it-does">What it does</h3>
<p>Defines key bundles and allows adding all of keys in the bundle to a running ssh-agent</p>
<h3 id="what-it-does-not">What it does not</h3>
<ul>
<li>aims at <em>command line</em> only, no graphic desktop/dependency. no DBus (no need)</li>
<li>does not compete with full-on private keys managers like <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Seahorse">Seahorse</a></li>
<li><code>ssh-agent</code> management. You run it, and have <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> properly pointing to the desired SSH Agent process</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Run in virtualenv: :</p>
<pre><code>pip install https://github.com/mvk/sshadder.git</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: The crypto path is not yet vetted, so do not install this system-wide just yet. Honestly :)</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites:</h3>
<p>Running and visible <code>ssh-agent</code></p>
<h3 id="normally">Normally:</h3>
<p>Run: :</p>
<pre><code>sshadder</code></pre>
<p>Please refer to <code>--help</code>, which shows default locations it's looking for the yaml files.</p>
<h3 id="initialization">Initialization:</h3>
<p>Run: :</p>
<pre><code>sshadder -i</code></pre>
<p>The text will guide you to give a master password (not saved anywhere), and then iterate over</p>
<ul>
<li>key file path</li>
<li>key password</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're ready, choose 's' option to save and quit.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-actually-happening">What is actually happening</h3>
<p>Given config file <code>.sshagent.yml</code> and master password, the utility adds all the ssh key files using their passwords <code>YAML</code> file keeps the key passwords encrypted using simple-crypt package. Each password is encrypted and then encoded using <code>Base64</code> and added to the key item. The text file is kept as it is now - text file.</p>
<p>Not sure how REALLY safe it is, but it is safer than plain text shell scripts.</p>
<h4 id="current-known-security-problems">Current known security problems</h4>
<p>As long as <code>pexpect.spawn()</code> is used here, it means if your system is compromised and rogue user can access your <code>/proc</code>, they probably can see the passwords passed to ssh-agent in clear text. If this is VERY unsafe for you, please send a patch/pull request :)</p>

<p>Patches/pull/feature requests are welcome to improve the code/fix bugs. Note I'm quite a busy person, so if you can fix/add it - send me a patch/pull-request.</p>
